# ResNet

## **!!WARNING: WORK IN PROGRESS!!**

This repository is one of the many projects I have created to showcase my knowledge of [Computer Vision](https://github.com/Computer-Vision-DMG) and [Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/Artificial-Intelligence-DMG).

The project may appear incomplete or not yet well-formed.

I am still in the process of transferring all the necessary information from my private project to the current one, ensuring that it contains sufficient material to serve as a useful repository with educational value.

Thank you for checking out this repository! Please feel free to check back soon or contribute if you'd like to help. Your feedback is always welcome.

## Content Expected for the ResNet repository

n this repository, you will find an explanation of how the *Degradation Problem* is addressed in the [ResNet paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385v1) and how the proposed model can be implemented from scratch.

**[Roadmap](##Roadmap):**

1. **[Prerequisites](###Prerequisites)** : A basic understanding of how neural networks work and why their deep counterparts were introduced.
2. [**Assumptions and Topic's Target**](###Assumption-and-Target): Addressing the *degradation problem* observed in previous deep learning models by following the author's hypothesis: "*that it*
   *is easier to optimize the residual mapping than to optimize the original, unreferenced mapping*". 
3. **[Theory](###Theory)**: A description of the *deep residual learning framework*, its working principle, and the results obtained in the ResNet paper.
4. **[Code](###Code)** : The Python implementation (and later, C++) of the ResNet model (ResNet-34) from scratch, including a custom Dataset and Dataloader.
5. **[Test](###Test)**:  A final test to demonstrate that the implementation works as expected and that the model can train correctly.

## Roadmap
